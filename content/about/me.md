Hi! I'm Philip,
a design student with a passion for coding. I believe that the combination of design and development allows me to create unique and impactful digital experiences.

As a design student, I have honed my skills in visual aesthetics, user experience, and problem-solving. I love exploring different design principles and experimenting with various tools and techniques to bring my ideas to life.
