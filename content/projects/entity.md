Existence is a constant process of transformation and evolution. An attempt to visualize this metamorphosis on aesthetic derivatives of everyday objects.

Although a lighter built today might not be able to light a candle in a thousand years, it will not truly vanish either. It has been transformed from something and will eventually transform into something else. However, because our observation period is limited so drastically we do not perceive a process but rather a static object. This work attempts to form an opposing perspective by generating abstract entities and imagining their visual decay.

A lightstrip illuminating the scanning bed indicates that the installation is ready for the next input. When a new object is placed on the surface, the lights fade out while the scanning process begins. Once the input has been analyzed, a new en- tity is projected onto the ceiling.
